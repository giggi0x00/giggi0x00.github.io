we begin with filtering and re-centering the signal to make later processing steps easier. for this task, we use a frequency-translating fir filter. this block takes two main inputs: a taps function and a center frequency.\nwhile the center frequency parameter is straightforward, the taps function can be less intuitive. in simple terms, the taps define the filter characteristics. for example, the low cutoff, high cutoff, or both, determine which frequency components are allowed to pass through. many others parameters are described in the documentation here.\nthe fir filter produces a new signal, shown below in the first waterfall plot:\nat the top, we can see a clean signal where only the relevant frequencies are passed through.\nas observed earlier, we identified that the signal uses fsk modulation, more specifically 2-fsk, based on the two peaks visible in the frequency sink. gnu radio provides a demodulation block called quadrature demod. although it is not designed only for 2-fsk, it can be configured appropriately for that purpose.\nin particular, setting the gain parameter to: samp_rate / (2 * math.pi * fsk_deviation) results in correct fsk demodulation. refer to the documentation for a deeper explanation of how this value is derived.\nplotting the output of the quadrature demod block reveals an almost “squared” signal, although it is not yet fully clean:\nas we can see, we can have already a good view on the demodulated signal and we can already spot some recurring patterns, such as the preamble we previously observed in inspectrum.\nso far, we haven\u0026rsquo;t achieved much more than previously done via inspectrum, but it is here that gnu radio comes into place.\ngnu radio post-processing gnu radio can further refine this signal for better processing, one useful block for this purpose is the moving average block. it improves signal squaring but more specifically it performs an average of the value in a specific interval taking out noise.\nsee below the plotted output: that completed the demodulation part, and in theory we could stop here and do further processing off gnu radio with a python script for example, but i want to provide an extra mile that made my life a bit easier when working with this signal and perhaps can help me in the future while dealing with similar transmissions.\nmessages extraction and preamble identification one additional step i wanted to implement for this ctf challenge was a reliable method to automatically detect each message, save it as an individual file, and process it independently.\nto perform this type of splitting, three modules can be used :\nburst tagger tagged file sink complex to mag we can use the magnitude of a signal to identify noise and then tag the sample where the noise starts and finishes. (it may not be the best way to do so but i found it very handy)\nthis approach becomes very powerful when searching for specific messages or when building post-acquisition routines that operate on a per-packet basis. for example, gnu radio supports custom python modules to process each packet, using tagged samples to determine the start and end of a transmission.\nbelow is an example of a post-processing function that handles tagged samples and processes each captured packet individually:\n[...] def work(self, input_items, output_items): inp = input_items[0] n = len(inp) # build dictionary of tags at positions tags = self.get_tags_in_window(0, 0, n) tag_positions = {t.offset - self.nitems_read(0): t for t in tags} for i in range(n): # --------------------------- # tag handling # --------------------------- if i in tag_positions: t = tag_positions[i] key = str(t.key) val = pmt.to_python(t.value) # debug print print(\u0026#34;tag:\u0026#34;, key, \u0026#34;value:\u0026#34;, val) # start burst if key == self.tag_key and val == 1: self.in_burst = true self.current_buf = [] # end burst elif key == self.tag_key and val == 0: self.in_burst = false # convert to numpy array burst = np.array(self.current_buf, dtype=np.float32) self.saved_bursts.append(burst) self.processed_bursts.append(burst) print(\u0026#34;captured packet length:\u0026#34;, len(burst)) print(f\u0026#34;packets captured{len(self.processed_bursts)}\u0026#34;) #print(\u0026#34;packet\u0026#34;) #print(burst); self.parse(burst) in a nutshell, the python block detects the preamble and uses the provided threshold parameter for similarity estimation. it then decodes the packet using the hamming algorithm and prints the payload to the screen. the full output is available on gnu radio in the console window.\nthe entire code can be found on my github repository https://github.com/giggi0x00/radio_signal_ctf_ctrl-space_ctf_2025.\nconclusion although i was unable to complete the challenge within the allocated time during the ctf, i continued working on it afterwards to learn more about radio signals and, in particular, the gnu radio tool, which can help speed up signal processing without reinventing the wheel. thank you for making it this far! happy hacking!\n","title":"h"},{"date":"2024-11-30","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://giggi0x00.github.io/posts/prepare-for-powernalaysis/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe purpose of this blog post is to provide a guide on how to prepare a device for fault injection and power analysis attacks.

type your password to unlock the device: the attack that will be carried out in order to circumvent this security defense is simple power analysis. the objective is to measure the power consumption of the device while we send different passwords. through a careful analysis will be possible to identify different cycles that a strcmp function will go through on each inputs\npreparation of the target [adding also where and how we tap there why are and what we are measuring]\nwe need to understand the pcb design, components, power lines, sources of randomness, potential security defenses, and any pcb components that could interfere with our attacks.\nfirst of all let\u0026rsquo;s start by understand the power inputs line of the device. these can be easily identified by following the vcc power lines of our mcu and the available pins.\nthe board has a publicly available datasheet; however, even without schematics, it is still possible to understand the power lines and make modifications in most cases. as we can see from the following schematic, there are many capacitors connected between the vcc and ground. these capacitors, are meant to stabilize the power of the device, ensuring stability and normal execution conditions ( decoupling capacitor). for our purposes we can consider the the decoupling capacitor as if they are device’s local energy storage.\nfirst schematic, let\u0026rsquo;s identify the capacitor based on what we have discussed earlier.\neven without a schematic, these type of capacitors can be identified using a multimeter and a careful inspection of the pcb design.\nthese capacitors were marked with yellow dots for identification.\nhowever, we can see that other capacitors are still present on the board. these capacitors are related the power input in the following diagram. while we could also consider to remove them, it is possible to bypass the power circuit line using the jp6 connector and disconnect the power lines from the rest of the circuit. this will allow us to have vcc lines not affected by any electronic components, making possible power analysis possible.\nhardware modifications the identified capacitors were disconnected from the board. as you can see from the following pictures only one pin was disconnected. the usage of soldering station or hot air gun could be very useful in these cases.\nhardware setup while preparing for the setup, always watch out for ground loop!!!\ntime to attack the password prompt! the board is now ready to be deeply analyzed for the power consumption, aiming to detect voltage fluctuations based on the execution cycles. the attack consists in attack one single byte of the password at the time. we can suppose that the device will compare the input with some value inside. this means that a routine like the following one could be implemented in the firmware:\nvoid checkpassoword(char *buffer) { int res = strcmp(spassword, buffer); if (res == 0) { //do something } ... } without going to much into the detail of the attack, we can simply understand the attack based on the following calculations:\nlet\u0026rsquo;s assume the correct value is amsdata.\nwe provide the following two inputs: amsaaaa and amddddd. the strcmp function compares each byte sequentially and returns when a match is found or a mismatch occurs. this means that the more correct characters we provide, the more execution cycles strcmp will take to complete, leading to a more power consumption.\nto fully understand the value of the hardware analysis and the changes made to the board, some power traces were collected before the modifications were implemented\nthe power traces correspond to the power measurements of the device while the inputs are being processed.\nlet\u0026rsquo;s have a look at how the power traces look like: the power traces before the modification look quite homogeneous, except some random spikes. it is very difficult to identify changes in the pattern across multiple inputs.\nthe following traces were collected with all capacitors disconnected from the pcb. as you can see, we have similar patterns as before; however, there is a noticeable change in the original power trace that requires further inspection.\nif we zoom into the beginning of the diagram, we can observe that the red trace diverges significantly from the rest of the power traces.\nfinal attack will come in the following post\u0026hellip; stay tuned!\n","title":"Prepare an IoT devices for Power Analysis and Fault Injection"},{"date":"2024-11-01","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://giggi0x00.github.io/pages/about/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHello folks!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou will find here stories, joy and suffer.

[\u0026hellip;] when first rdp level, level 0, is set, the device has no protection. all read or write operations (if no write protection is set) on the flash memory or the backup sram are possible in all boot configurations (flash user boot, debug or boot from ram). option bytes are also changeable in this level.\nrdp levels :\nlevel 0 is is the factory default level. in level 1, read protection is set for the flash memory, the backup sram and the backup registers is set. in this level, protected memories are only accessible when booting from user flash memory. whenever a debugger access is detected or boot is not set to a flash memory area, any access to the protected memories generates a system hard fault which blocks all code execution until the next power-on reset* in level 2, all protections from level 1, plus no swd/jtag connection possible, no going back. rdp/wrp option bytes can no longer be changed. stm32 bootloader stm32 provides multiple options for accessing the flash memory. these protocols can be accessed either through the swd interface or a built-in system bootloader, which is available in almost all stm32 devices at address 0x1fff0000. the system bootloader allows users to interact with the stm32 device using various protocols to perform operations such as programming, erasing, or reading memory sectors. the protocols available include swd, spi, uart, and others.\ndue to its simplicity, this discussion will focus on the uart protocol and how it interfaces with the bootloader.\nthe following commands are accessible via the uart interface:\nwithout any protection enabled, the read command (0x11) successfully retrieves 256 bytes from the specified page address. however, when read out protection is activated, this operation is rejected. to gain a deeper understanding of how this mechanism is implemented, the system bootloader was reverse-engineered.\nwe can observe the commands being parsed in the following screenshot:\nthe function proceeds by checking for the presence of the read out protection mechanism:\nthis was verified by observing the value read just before the operation. the highlighted address, 0x400023c14, confirms that the system checks the status of the read out protection mechanism.\nit becomes evident that, to gain access to the flash memory, the highlighted if statement must be targeted for a fault injection attack.\nenvironment setup the environment consists of the following devices and tools:\nstm32f401cc developer board cw1173 chipwhisperer-lite usb-uart ttl converter st link programmer the device was programmed with a dummy firmware for testing and the read out protection was set as shown in the following picture:\nbefore proceeding with the attack, it is important to determine how and when to glitch the device. the chosen technique for this attack is voltage fault injection, which involves briefly dropping the device\u0026rsquo;s power supply just enough to cause it to skip instructions. ideally, the glitch should occur precisely when the device is checking the read out protection, resulting in either skipped instructions or a malformed data read.\nto generate an effective voltage injection, it is very important to carefully review the target device and remove any potential sources of disruption to the glitch, such as voltage regulators, bypass capacitors, and similar components. additionally, understanding the power domain of the device is fundamental to identifying the optimal point for injecting the glitch.\npower supply schema\nas observed, all vdd voltage is routed through an internal voltage regulator within the soc. however, the pins vcap_1 and vcap_2 are directly connected to the core power domain, making them ideal targets for the voltage injection.\nhardware preparation a cable was soldered at the vcap_1 the boot1 pin was manually forged to high to have the device starting from the system bootloader at each reboot. usart interface connected to the usb-uart ttl converted reset pin connected to the chipwhisperer tio4 important: the external uart-ttl converter is important because chipwhisperer does not support uart parity configuration.\nexecution once the hardware setup is properly configured, we are ready to determine the optimal glitch parameters.\nhowever, before targeting the read out protection function within the bootloader, it is important to identify the minimum glitch settings required to induce a successful fault and cause the device to skip instructions. a simple routine like the one below can serve as a starting point:\n[...] for (i = 0;
